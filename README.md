# Everforest Enchanted (My Fork)

This is a personal fork of the **[Everforest Enchanted](https://github.com/FireIsGood/obsidian-everforest-enchanted)** theme for Obsidian. I'm a big fan of the Everforest theme family, but I often find myself tweaking a few things for personal preference. This fork is a space for me to do that and learn along the way.

An Obsidian port of the [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) theme family. Heavily inspired by [another project of a similar name](https://github.com/0xGlitchbyte/obsidian_everforest) with my custom additions.

I had some issues with the styling of the other project, but the codebase was very different to what the semantics of the official theme area, so I decided to remake the entire thing from scratch.

You can get extra customization through the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
